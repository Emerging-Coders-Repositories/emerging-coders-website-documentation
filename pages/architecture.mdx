## Project Directory Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- **Root Directory**: Contains configuration files like `.eslintrc.json`, `next.config.js`, `package.json`, and others.
- **public**: This directory contains various images and other static assets (like the exec board pictures or flyers for our events).
- **src/app**: This is the main directory where the application's components and pages are located.
  - **Components**: Contains various React components used throughout the application.
  - **Events, Opportunities, Additional-Resources, etc.**: These directories contain specific pages or sections of the website.
  - **Additional-Resources, Contact, Events, FAQ, etc.**: Because we are using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) from Next.JS 13, any of the files inside of the `app/` directory with a file `page.js` will be considered to be pages in the app. This is beneficial because we can use the same components for both the main page and the mobile menu and we don't have to rely on dependencies like `react-router-dom` for page navigation. **this is a very big concept and component of the app so please make sure you read the documentation on it.**


## Flow of Data within the Application
- The application primarily uses React components to render and manage its data.
- For dynamic data, such as sending contact messages, the application interacts with external servers (as seen in the `ContactComponent`). Don't worry too much about this, we will be building out the server more in the future but the focus is on the front end currently. 
- Components like `EventCard` and `ExecBoardCards` receive data as props and display them accordingly.
- The application also uses animations and visibility checks to enhance user experience, as seen in the `FadeInAnimation` component.
