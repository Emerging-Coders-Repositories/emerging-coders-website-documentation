# `TechnicalInterviewsTypes` Component Documentation

The `TechnicalInterviewsTypes` component is a React component designed to provide insight into various types of technical interviews that candidates might encounter when applying for software engineering positions. The component utilizes the `Tabs`, `Tab`, `Card`, and `CardBody` components from the `@nextui-org/react` library to organize and display the types of technical interviews.

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

## State

No state is being managed within this component.

## Rendered UI

The `TechnicalInterviewsTypes` component renders a section containing a title, a brief introductory paragraph, a tabs component with four tabs for different types of technical interviews, and a concluding paragraph. Each tab contains a card with details about a specific type of technical interview.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import TechnicalInterviewsTypes from "./TechnicalInterviewsTypes";

function App() {
    return (
        <TechnicalInterviewsTypes />
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Behavior

- The component initializes a constant array `typeOfInterviewsTabs` with predefined objects, each representing a type of technical interview.
- The `Tabs` component from `@nextui-org/react` is used to render a tabs interface, with each `Tab` representing a single type of technical interview.
- Clicking on a tab displays the corresponding information about that type of technical interview.

## Styling

- The component utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling, along with the default styles provided by the `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Tabs`, `Tab`, `Card`, and `CardBody` components.
- The dark mode styling is also handled through Tailwind CSS classes, with a conditional rendering based on a `dark` class.

## Accessibility

- The `Tabs` and `Tab` components have appropriate ARIA roles, properties, and states to ensure that the tabs interface is accessible.
- The `aria-label` property is set on the `Tabs` component to provide an accessible label.

## Dependencies

- React
- `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Tabs`, `Tab`, `Card`, and `CardBody` components.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Customization

- The types of technical interviews and their descriptions can be customized by modifying the content of the `typeOfInterviewsTabs` array.
- Additional styling and theming can be applied by extending or overriding the Tailwind CSS classes or by applying custom styles.

## Cleanup

No specific cleanup is required for this component as there are no side effects being managed.

## External Content

The content of the types of technical interviews is hardcoded within the component. Any change in the content would require a change in the component code.

## Intersection with Other Components

The `TechnicalInterviewsTypes` component is intended to be used independently and does not have direct dependencies on other components. However, it can be integrated into larger page layouts or used alongside other components to build a comprehensive technical interview guide or page.
