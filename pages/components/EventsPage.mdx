# EventsPage Component Documentation

The `EventsPage` component serves as a dedicated page within your web application for displaying upcoming events. It incorporates a separate `UpcomingEventsComponent` to list the upcoming events and provides a navigation button to view past events.

## Props

The `EventsPage` component does not accept any props as it is designed to be self-contained.

## Rendered UI

The `EventsPage` component renders the following UI elements:

- A page title ("View Our Events Below") and a descriptive paragraph, both centrally aligned.
- The `UpcomingEventsComponent` which presumably lists the upcoming events.
- A button labeled "View Our Past Events" which navigates to a page listing past events.

## Usage

The `EventsPage` component can be utilized wherever a dedicated events page is required in your application. Below is an example of how to use the `EventsPage` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import EventsPage from "./EventsPage";

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <EventsPage />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Component Structure

The `EventsPage` component is structured as follows:

- A container `div` with a white background that expands to at least the full height of the viewport.
- A nested `div` that provides padding and centers the content within a maximum width.
- A title and description paragraph providing information about the events.
- The `UpcomingEventsComponent` that is presumed to render the list of upcoming events.
- A `Button` component from the `next-ui` library that navigates to a page listing past events.

## Dependencies

- React
- next-ui (for the `Button` and `Link` components)

## Styling

The component utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling which allows for a clean and modern design with utility classes directly applied in the markup. The `dark` mode styles are conditionally applied based on a parent element's class.

## Accessibility

The component makes use of semantic HTML elements which provide a basic level of accessibility. Further accessibility improvements can be achieved by ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and have appropriate ARIA attributes.

## Customization

The appearance and behavior of the `EventsPage` component can be customized by adjusting the Tailwind CSS classes, HTML structure, or by passing additional props to the `UpcomingEventsComponent` if required. The navigation URL in the "View Our Past Events" button can also be updated to match the routing structure of your application.
