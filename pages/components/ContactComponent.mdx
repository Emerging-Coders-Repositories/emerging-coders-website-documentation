# ContactComponent Documentation

The `ContactComponent` is a React component designed to provide a contact form for users to send messages. It handles form submission, input validation, and displays modals on successful submission or error.

## Props

The `ContactComponent` does not accept any props as it is self-contained.

## State Variables

- `email`, `subject`, `message`: These state variables hold the values entered in the respective fields of the contact form.
- `isOpen`, `onOpen`, `onOpenChange`: These are derived from the `useDisclosure` hook to manage the modal's open/close state.
- `isFormSubmitted`: A boolean that tracks if the form has been successfully submitted.
- `isFormSubmitting`: A boolean that tracks if the form is currently being submitted.
- `formError`: A boolean that tracks if there has been an error in form submission.

## Rendered UI

The `ContactComponent` renders the following UI elements:

- A contact form with fields for email, subject, and message.
- A "Send Message" button to submit the form.
- Two different modals for successful form submission and error in form submission.

## Form Submission

The form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` function which:
1. Prevents the default form submission behavior.
2. Sets `isFormSubmitting` to `true`.
3. Sends a POST request to a server with the form data.
4. On success, sets `isFormSubmitting` to `false`, and `isFormSubmitted` to `true` to trigger the success modal.
5. On error, logs the error to console, sets `isFormSubmitting` to `false`, and `formError` to `true` to trigger the error modal.

## Modal Displays

- **Success Modal**: Displayed when `isFormSubmitted` is `true`, thanking the user for their message and providing further contact info and navigation options.
- **Error Modal**: Displayed when `formError` is `true`, apologizing for the inconvenience and providing an email address for direct contact.

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and the Next UI library for the modal and button components, achieving a clean and modern aesthetic.

## Dependencies

- React
- Next UI library (`@nextui-org/react`)
- Axios for handling HTTP requests.

## Usage

The `ContactComponent` is self-contained and can be utilized as a standalone contact page in your application. It can be imported and used in other parts of your application as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ContactComponent from "./ContactComponent";

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <ContactComponent />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Accessibility

The form fields and buttons are labeled and accessible. Further accessibility improvements can be achieved by ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable, and by providing appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.

## Customization

The `ContactComponent` can be customized by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes, HTML structure, or by adjusting the axios `post` request in the `handleSubmit` function to match your server's API endpoint and requirements.
