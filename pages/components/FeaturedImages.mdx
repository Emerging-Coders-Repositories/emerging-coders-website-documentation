## Rendered UI

The `FeaturedImage` component renders a grid of images with a larger featured image followed by a grid of smaller images below it. Each image is styled with rounded corners.

## Behavior

There's no interactive behavior associated with this component.

## Styling

- The component employs Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- The `rounded-lg` class provides rounded corners to each image.
- The `grid` and `grid-cols-5` classes are used to create a grid layout for the images.
- The `gap-4` and `gap-5` classes provide spacing between grid items.
- The `max-w-xl` class on the outer `div` sets a maximum width for the component.

## Accessibility

- Alt text is not provided for the images, which is a potential accessibility issue. It's recommended to add meaningful alt text to each image to improve accessibility.

```jsx
<img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg" src="/Photo3.png" alt="Description of Image" />
```

## Dependencies
