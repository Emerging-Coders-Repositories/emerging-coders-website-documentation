# `LandingPageCoverText` Component Documentation

The `LandingPageCoverText` component is designed to showcase the central message of the Emerging Coders community on the landing page of the application. It combines a headline, a subheadline, and action buttons, all presented with a fade-in animation effect.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react"; 
import { Button } from "@nextui-org/react";
import FadeInAnimation from "../FadeInAnimation/FadeInAnimation.jsx";

export default function LandingPageCoverText() {

    return (
        <div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center px-4 text-center text-black gap-5">
            <FadeInAnimation>
                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl">Emerging Coders</h1>
                <p class="mt-2 text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">Northwestern University's Community of First-Generation and Low-Income Technologist</p>
                <div class="flex flex-row justify-center mt-6 space-x-4 gap-2">
                    <Button color="secondary"  onPress={() => window.open("https://groupme.com/join_group/89417887/c1x6DI3U", "_blank")}>
                        Join
                    </Button>
                    <Button color="secondary">
                        <a href="#About" name="About">About</a>
                    </Button>
                </div>
            </FadeInAnimation>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<LandingPageCoverText />
```

## Rendered UI

- The title "Emerging Coders" displayed in large, bold text.
- A subtitle describing the community.
- Two buttons - one for joining the community and another to navigate to the 'About' section.

## Behavior

- The content inside the component fades in on render, thanks to the wrapping `FadeInAnimation` component.
- Clicking the "Join" button opens a new tab directing the user to a GroupMe joining link.
- Clicking the "About" button navigates the user to the 'About' section of the page.

## Styling

- The component utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling:
    - `flex`, `flex-col`, `items-center`, `justify-center`, `px-4`, `text-center`, `text-black`, and `gap-5` for layout and spacing.
    - Font sizes and weights are controlled with classes like `text-4xl`, `font-bold`, etc.
- The buttons use the `@nextui-org/react` library's `Button` component, with a color of 'secondary'.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the fade-in effect does not hinder accessibility for users with motion sensitivity or other accessibility needs.

## Dependencies

- React
- `@nextui-org/react` for the `Button` component.
- `FadeInAnimation` component from `../FadeInAnimation/FadeInAnimation.jsx`.

## Customization

- The text content, button labels, and URLs can be updated to reflect any changes in branding or organization details.
- The `FadeInAnimation` effect can be customized or replaced to match desired visual styling.
- Button colors and styles can be altered via the `@nextui-org/react` library's `Button` component.

## External Content

- The 'Join' button directs users to an external GroupMe link.

## Intersection with Other Components

- This component is intended to be used within the `LandingPageCover` component to provide a textual overlay on top of the animated background.

## Cleanup

- No specific cleanup is required as there are no side effects being managed outside of the `FadeInAnimation` component.

The `LandingPageCoverText` component serves to engage visitors right from the landing page by providing a clear headline, subheadline, and call-to-action buttons. The fade-in animation adds a pleasing visual effect that draws attention to the core message of the Emerging Coders community.
