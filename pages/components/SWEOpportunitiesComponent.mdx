# `OpportunitiesComponent` Component Documentation

The `OpportunitiesComponent` is a React component designed to fetch, display, and allow searching through a list of summer 2024 internships from a README.md file hosted on a specified URL.

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

## State

The following state variables are managed within this component:
- `readmeData`: Holds the data fetched from the README.md file.
- `jobsList`: Holds the list of jobs parsed from the README.md file.
- `fetchingError`: Indicates if there was an error fetching the README.md file.
- `isFetching`: Indicates if the data is currently being fetched.
- `page`: Holds the current page number for pagination.
- `pages`: Holds the total number of pages for pagination.
- `search`: Holds the search query for filtering jobs.
- `rowsPerPage`: Holds the number of rows per page, with a default value of 20.

## Rendered UI

The `OpportunitiesComponent` renders a section containing:
- A title and subtitle.
- A search input for filtering job listings.
- A table displaying the company name, job title, application link, and the date the job was added.
- Pagination controls for navigating through the list of jobs.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import OpportunitiesComponent from "./OpportunitiesComponent";

function App() {
    return (
        <OpportunitiesComponent />
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Behavior

- On component mount, `fetchREADME` function is called to fetch the README.md file from a specified URL.
- The `decodeREADME` function is then called to parse the README.md file into a list of jobs using a regex pattern.
- The `handleSearch` function updates the `search` state variable whenever the search input value changes.
- The `filteredJobs` useMemo hook filters the `jobsList` based on the search query.
- The `Pagination` component from `@nextui-org/react` is used to manage and display pagination controls.

## Styling

- The component utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling, along with the default styles provided by the `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Progress`, `Tab`, and `Pagination` components.
- The dark mode styling is also handled through Tailwind CSS classes, with a conditional rendering based on a `dark` class.

## Accessibility

- The `NextTable` component from `@nextui-org/react` is used to render a table with appropriate ARIA roles, properties, and states ensuring accessibility.
- The search input has an associated label (though visually hidden) to provide an accessible name.
- Links within the table have `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes for security when opening external links.

## Dependencies

- React
- `axios` library for making the HTTP request.
- `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Progress`, `Tab`, `NextTable`, `Pagination`, and other UI components.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Customization

- The URL for fetching the README.md file can be customized by updating the `readmeURL` variable within the `fetchREADME` function.
- The regex pattern within the `decodeREADME` function can be modified to match a different data format within the README.md file.

## Cleanup

No specific cleanup is required for this component as there are no side effects being managed.

## External Content

- The content of the job listings is fetched from an external README.md file.
- Any change in the job listings content would require an update to the external README.md file.

## Intersection with Other Components

The `OpportunitiesComponent` is intended to be used independently and does not have direct dependencies on other components. However, it can be integrated into larger page layouts or used alongside other components to build a comprehensive job opportunities section or page.
