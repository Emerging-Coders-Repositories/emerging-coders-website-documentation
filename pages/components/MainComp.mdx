import { NextUIProvider } from "@nextui-org/react";

export default function MainComp() {
    return (
        <div>
            <NextUIProvider>
                <NavigationBar />
                <LandingPage />
                <Footer />

## Usage

```jsx
<MainComp />
```

## Rendered UI

- A `NavigationBar` at the top of the page.
- A `LandingPage` component serving as the main content area.
- A `Footer` component at the bottom of the page.

## Behavior

- The `MainComp` component acts as a container and structural framework for your application, ensuring the correct order and arrangement of the `NavigationBar`, `LandingPage`, and `Footer` components.

## Styling

- There's no explicit styling applied to the `MainComp` component itself. However, it encapsulates other components (`NavigationBar`, `LandingPage`, `Footer`) that come with their own styling.
- The `NextUIProvider` wrapper ensures that styles and behaviors from the `@nextui-org/react` library are correctly applied to components within.

## Accessibility

- Ensure that the encapsulated components (`NavigationBar`, `LandingPage`, `Footer`) adhere to accessibility standards to create a user-friendly experience for all visitors, including those using assistive technologies.

## Dependencies

- React
- `@nextui-org/react` for the `NextUIProvider`.
- `NavigationBar` component from `../NavigationBar/NavigationBar`.
- `Footer` component from `../Footer/Footer`.
- `LandingPage` component from `../LandingPage/LandingPage`.

## Customization

- The `MainComp` component can be extended by including additional sections or components as needed.
- The order or structure of encapsulated components can be adjusted to meet the design requirements of your application.

## Intersection with Other Components

- This component acts as the primary container for the `NavigationBar`, `LandingPage`, and `Footer` components, ensuring they are rendered in the correct order.

## Cleanup

- No specific cleanup is required as there are no side effects being managed.

The `MainComp` component is crucial as it organizes and renders the primary sections of your application. By encapsulating the `NavigationBar`, `LandingPage`, and `Footer` components within a `NextUIProvider`, it ensures that your application benefits from the styling and behavior utilities provided by the `@nextui-org/react` library.
