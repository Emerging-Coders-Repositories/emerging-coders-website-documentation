# `PastEventsGrid` Component Documentation

The `PastEventsGrid` component is a simple grid layout to showcase images from past events. It is designed to dynamically render images within a grid structure.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react"; 

export default function PastEventsGrid() {
    // ... component code ...
    return (
        // ... JSX markup ...
    );
};
```

## Props

The component signature suggests it could accept props, but currently, it doesn't accept or use any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<PastEventsGrid />
```

## Rendered UI

The component renders a grid of images with two columns on smaller screens and three columns on medium and larger screens. Each image is displayed within a rounded container.

## Behavior

- **Image Rendering:** The component iterates through an array of image URLs, rendering an `img` element for each image.
- **Responsive Layout:** The grid adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size, transitioning from a 2-column layout to a 3-column layout at the medium breakpoint.

## Styling

- **Grid Layout:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS's grid utilities to create a responsive grid layout.
- **Image Styling:** Images are styled to have rounded corners and to scale responsively with the grid containers.
