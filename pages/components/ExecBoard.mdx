# ExecBoard Component Documentation

The `ExecBoard` component serves as a container for rendering a list of executive board members using the `ExecBoardCards` component. The component is structured to display a section with a title, a description, and a grid of cards each representing a board member.

## State and Effects

- `visibleMembers` (array): A stateful array that holds the list of members which should be visible on the screen.
- `execBoardMembers` (array): An array containing objects with details about each board member.
- `useEffect`: A hook that sets up an interval to gradually reveal each executive board member card with a slight delay, providing an animation effect. The interval is cleared when the component unmounts or when all members are visible.

## Rendered UI

The `ExecBoard` component renders the following UI elements:

- A section with a `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900` background color.
- A title ("Meet the Emerging Coders Team") and a description paragraph.
- A grid container that holds individual `ExecBoardCards` components, each representing a board member. The grid adapts to different screen sizes with responsive column layouts.

## Usage

The `ExecBoard` component is self-contained and can be imported and used in other parts of the application. Below is an example of how to use the `ExecBoard` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ExecBoard from "./ExecBoard";

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <ExecBoard />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Component Structure

- The `ExecBoard` component initializes with an empty `visibleMembers` array.
- The `useEffect` hook sets up an interval to update `visibleMembers`, gradually adding one member at a time from the `execBoardMembers` array to the `visibleMembers` array every 80 milliseconds.
- The `ExecBoardCards` component is used to render each member's card within a responsive grid. The `isVisible` prop of each `ExecBoardCards` component is determined by whether the member is present in the `visibleMembers` array, controlling the visibility and transition effect of the cards.

## Dependencies

- React
- next-ui (for the `ExecBoardCards` component)

## Accessibility

This component adheres to basic accessibility standards with semantic HTML elements and a clear heading structure. Further accessibility improvements can be made by ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and by providing appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which provides utility classes to build custom designs directly in your markup. The dark mode styles are applied conditionally based on the `dark` class in the parent element.

## Customization

To customize the appearance or behavior of the `ExecBoard` component, you may modify the `execBoardMembers` array or adjust the Tailwind CSS classes and HTML structure within the render method.
