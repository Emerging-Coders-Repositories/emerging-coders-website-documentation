# `PastEventsComponent` Component Documentation

The `PastEventsComponent` component showcases past events conducted by Emerging Coders in a structured layout, providing a glimpse of the organization's activities to visitors.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react"; 
import PastEventsGrid from "../PastEventsGrid/PastEventsGrid";
import FadeInAnimation from "../FadeInAnimation/FadeInAnimation";

export default function PastEventsComponent() {
    // ... component code
    return (
        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-10">
            {/* ... JSX markup */}
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<PastEventsComponent />
```

## Rendered UI

- The component renders a section with the title "What We've Done," a description of past events, and a link to the upcoming events page.
- Nested within this component is the `PastEventsGrid` component that likely displays a grid of past events.
- The entire section is wrapped within a `FadeInAnimation` component, which likely provides a fade-in animation effect upon rendering.

## Behavior

- The component provides a static UI section showcasing past events, with a nested grid of events and a text description.
- The link within the text description navigates users to the upcoming events page when clicked.

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS classes are utilized for styling purposes, providing a clean and structured layout.
- A light gray background (`bg-gray-50`) is applied to the main div element, providing a subtle contrast against the content.

## Accessibility

- The `PastEventsComponent` does not include specific accessibility features outside of standard HTML semantics.

## Dependencies

- The `PastEventsComponent` depends on the `PastEventsGrid` and `FadeInAnimation` components, which must be correctly imported and functional for the `PastEventsComponent` to render as intended.

## Code Improvements and Suggestions

- Consider adding a `className` attribute instead of `class` to adhere to JSX syntax standards.
- Ensure that the `PastEventsGrid` component is adequately documented and tested, as it is a nested dependency.
- The `dark:gray-300` class appears to be a typo. It should be `dark:text-gray-300` to ensure the text color is styled correctly in dark mode.
- Make sure that the `href` link `/UpcomingEvents` routes to the correct page, and that the page is correctly set up to handle this route.
- Ensure that the `FadeInAnimation` component is well-documented and tested to ensure a smooth animation experience.
