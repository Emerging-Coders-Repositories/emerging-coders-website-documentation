# FAQComponent Component Documentation

The `FAQComponent` is a React component designed to display a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their answers in an accordion format. The component utilizes the `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components from the `@nextui-org/react` library to organize and display the FAQs.

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

## State

There is no state being managed within this component.

## Rendered UI

The `FAQComponent` renders a section containing a title, a subtitle, and an accordion with multiple items. Each item in the accordion represents a FAQ.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import FAQComponent from "./FAQComponent";

function App() {
    return (
        <FAQComponent />
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Behavior

- The component initializes a constant array `answers` with predefined answers to the FAQs.
- The `Accordion` component from `@nextui-org/react` is used to render an accordion interface, with each `AccordionItem` representing a single FAQ.
- The `title` prop of each `AccordionItem` is set to the question, and the child content of each `AccordionItem` is set to the corresponding answer from the `answers` array.
- The accordion supports multiple items being open at the same time.

## Styling

- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, along with the default styles provided by the `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components.
- The dark mode styling is also handled through Tailwind CSS classes, with a conditional rendering based on a `dark` class.

## Accessibility

- The `AccordionItem` components have `aria-label` properties set to provide accessible labels.
- The structure of the accordion and the use of ARIA roles, properties, and states provided by the `@nextui-org/react` library ensure that the accordion is accessible.

## Dependencies

- React
- `@nextui-org/react` library for the `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Customization

- The questions and answers can be customized by modifying the content of the `answers` array and the `title` prop of each `AccordionItem`.
- Additional styling and theming can be applied by extending or overriding the Tailwind CSS classes or by applying custom styles.

## Cleanup

No specific cleanup is required for this component as there are no side effects being managed.

## External Content

The content of the FAQs is hard-coded within the component. Any change in the FAQ content would require a change in the component code.

## Intersection with Other Components

The `FAQComponent` is intended to be used independently and does not have direct dependencies on other components. However, it can be integrated into larger page layouts or used alongside other components to build a comprehensive FAQ section or page.
