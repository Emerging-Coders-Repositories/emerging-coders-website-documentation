# `Footer` Component Documentation

The `Footer` component serves as the footer section of a webpage. It includes navigational links, copyright information, and credits. It's designed to be a common footer across different pages of the web application.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function Footer() {

    // ... component definition

    return (
        <footer class="p-4 bg-gray-800 md:p-8 lg:p-10 dark:bg-gray-800 z-100">
            {/* ... JSX markup */}
        </footer>
    );
};
```

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<Footer />
```

## Rendered UI

The `Footer` component renders a footer section containing:
- The title "Emerging Coders".
- A set of navigation links.
- Copyright and creator credit information.
- A link to an open-source contribution page.

## Behavior

- Each navigation link redirects the user to a different page within the web application when clicked.
- The link to the creator's LinkedIn profile and the open-source contribution page open in a new tab when clicked.

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS is used for styling the component.
- The `bg-gray-800` and `dark:bg-gray-800` classes set the background color of the footer.
- The `p-4`, `md:p-8`, and `lg:p-10` classes set the padding for the footer across different screen sizes.
- The `text-white` and `dark:text-gray-400` classes set the text color.
- The `hover:underline` class adds an underline to links when they are hovered over.

## Accessibility

- `a` elements should have discernible text for screen readers. The `a` elements linking to the creator's LinkedIn profile and the open-source contribution page should have an `aria-label` attribute to describe the destination.
  
```jsx
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanpineda/" target="blank" aria-label="Ethan Pineda LinkedIn Profile" class="hover:underline">Ethan Pineda</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ethanpaneraa/Emerging-Coders-Website" target="blank" aria-label="Open Source Contribution Page on GitHub" class="hover:underline">here</a>
```

## Dependencies

- React
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Customization

- Update the `links` array to reflect the actual pages and URLs of the web application.
- Change the `href` attribute of the `a` elements to point to the correct URLs for the creator's LinkedIn profile and the open-source contribution page.
- Update the text and styling as needed to match the branding of the web application.

## External Content

The links to the creator's LinkedIn profile and the open-source contribution page are external content. Ensure that the URLs are correct.

## Intersection with Other Components

The `Footer` component can be included in the layout of pages across the web application to provide consistent navigation and information.

## Cleanup

No specific cleanup is required for this component as there are no side effects being managed.

The `Footer` component is a crucial part of the web application's layout, providing necessary navigational links and information to users in a visually appealing and accessible manner.
