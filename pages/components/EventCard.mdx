# EventCard Component Documentation

The `EventCard` component is designed to display details of an event in a card format. It renders an image, title, date, time, description, and location of an event. Additionally, it provides an "Add to Calendar" button for upcoming events, utilizing the `AddToCalendarButton` component from 'add-to-calendar-button-react' library.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `imageUrl` (string): URL of the image representing the event.
- `title` (string): Title of the event.
- `date` (string): Date of the event.
- `time` (string): Start time of the event.
- `endTime` (string): End time of the event.
- `description` (string): Description of the event.
- `location` (string): Location of the event.
- `formattedDate` (string): Formatted date of the event.
- `formattedStartTime` (string): Formatted start time of the event.
- `formattedEndTime` (string): Formatted end time of the event.
- `upcoming` (boolean): Flag indicating whether the event is upcoming.

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the `EventCard` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./EventCard";

function App() {
    return (
        <EventCard
            imageUrl="https://example.com/image.jpg"
            title="Coding Workshop"
            date="2023-11-25"
            time="10:00 AM"
            endTime="12:00 PM"
            description="A workshop on basic coding principles."
            location="Online"
            formattedDate="November 25, 2023"
            formattedStartTime="10:00 AM"
            formattedEndTime="12:00 PM"
            upcoming={true}
        />
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Rendered UI

The `EventCard` component renders a card with the following UI elements:

- An image of the event.
- The title, location, date, and time of the event.
- A paragraph for the description of the event.
- An "Add to Calendar" button for upcoming events, which triggers a modal allowing users to add the event to their preferred calendar.

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, creating a clean and modern design. The `dark` mode styles are conditionally applied based on a parent element's class.

## Dependencies

- React
- `add-to-calendar-button-react` library for the "Add to Calendar" functionality.

## Accessibility

The image includes an `alt` attribute to provide a text alternative for screen readers, improving the accessibility of the component. Further accessibility improvements can be made by ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and by providing appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.

## Customization

To customize the appearance or behavior of the `EventCard` component, you may modify the Tailwind CSS classes, HTML structure, or adjust the properties of the `AddToCalendarButton` component.
