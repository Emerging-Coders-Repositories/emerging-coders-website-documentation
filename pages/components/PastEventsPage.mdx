# `PastEvents` Component Documentation

The `PastEvents` component is responsible for fetching, formatting, and displaying past events data from a database using Supabase. It provides an archive view where users can see details about past events.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react"; 
// ... imports ...
export default function PastEvents() {
    // ... component code ...
    return (
        // ... JSX markup ...
    );
};
```

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<PastEvents />
```

## Rendered UI

1. **Fetching State:** When data is being fetched, a loading message along with a loading spinner is displayed.
2. **No Events State:** If there are no past events, a message indicating this is shown.
3. **Events Display:** When there are past events, they are displayed in an `EventCard` component for each event.

## Behavior

- **Data Fetching:** The component fetches past events data from the `eventData` table in Supabase. It orders the data by date in descending order and filters out any events scheduled for a future date.
- **Date and Time Formatting:** The component includes two utility functions, `formatDate` and `convertTo12HourTime`, for formatting date and time values.
- **Display Logic:** The component has three primary states:
   - **Fetching State:** Displayed while data is being fetched.
   - **No Events State:** Displayed if there are no past events.
   - **Events Display:** Displayed when there are past events.

## Styling

- The component employs Tailwind CSS for styling, making use of utility classes for layout, spacing, and typography.
- The `@nextui-org/react` library is used for displaying a loading spinner (`Progress` component) during the fetching state.

## Accessibility

- The component contains appropriate ARIA roles and attributes, such as `aria-label`, to ensure the loading state is accessible.

## Dependencies
