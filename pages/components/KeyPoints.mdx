# `KeyPoints` Component Documentation

The `KeyPoints` component serves as a section on a webpage to highlight the key objectives or activities of Emerging Coders. It is structured to present three main points: Mentorship, Technical Development, and Establishing Community, each accompanied by an icon, title, and description.

## Component Structure

```jsx
import React from "react"; 
import FadeInAnimation from "../FadeInAnimation/FadeInAnimation";

export default function KeyPoints() {

    // ... component definition

    return (
        <div class="py-8 px-10 mx-auto max-w-screen-2xl text-center lg:py-16 lg:px-6">
            <FadeInAnimation>
                {/* ... JSX markup */}
            </FadeInAnimation>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Usage

```jsx
<KeyPoints />
```

## Rendered UI

The `KeyPoints` component renders a section with a title "What We Do At Emerging Coders" and three sub-sections with icons, titles, and descriptions explaining the key activities or points of focus.

## Behavior

- The component uses the `FadeInAnimation` component to apply a fading animation as it comes into view.

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS is used for styling the component.
- The `py-8`, `px-10`, `mx-auto`, `max-w-screen-2xl`, `text-center`, `lg:py-16`, and `lg:px-6` classes are used to apply padding, margin, and text alignment styles to the component.
- The `text-neutral-500`, `dark:text-neutral-300`, `text-neutral-200`, and `dark:text-neutral-200` classes are used to apply text color styles to the descriptions.
- The `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, `text-gray-900`, `md:text-4xl`, `dark:text-black`, and `my-11` classes are used to style the section title.
- The `grid`, `gap-x-6`, `md:grid-cols-3`, `lg:gap-x-12`, and `mb-12` classes are used to create a grid layout for the three sub-sections.

## Accessibility

- `svg` elements should have a `role="img"` attribute, and a `<title>` child element with a descriptive text.
  
```jsx
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="black" class="h-6 w-6" role="img">
    <title>Mentorship Icon</title>
    {/* ... */}
</svg>
```

- Additionally, meaningful images should have an `alt` text. Since the icons in this component are purely decorative, they do not need an `alt` text.

## Dependencies

- React
- `FadeInAnimation` component from `../FadeInAnimation/FadeInAnimation`
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Customization

- The content in the `KeyPoints` component can be updated to reflect the actual key points of focus or activities.
- Icons and colors can be updated to match the branding and design system of the web application.

## Intersection with Other Components

## Cleanup

No specific cleanup is required for this component as there are no side effects being managed.

The `KeyPoints` component is a well-structured and visually appealing way to convey the main objectives or activities of Emerging Coders to the users, making it an essential part of the web application's content strategy.
