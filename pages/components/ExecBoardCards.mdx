# ExecBoardCards Component Documentation

The `ExecBoardCards` component is a React component designed to display information about a member of the executive board in a card format. This component utilizes Tailwind CSS and Next.UI for a modern and clean aesthetic.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `role` (string): The role or title of the board member.
- `name` (string): The name of the board member.
- `pronouns` (string): The pronouns of the board member.
- `major` (string): The major or field of study of the board member.
- `classStanding` (string): The class standing of the board member.
- `linkedin` (string): The LinkedIn profile URL of the board member.
- `img` (string): The URL of the image representing the board member.
- `email` (string): The email address of the board member.
- `website` (string, optional): The personal website URL of the board member.
- `isVisible` (boolean): A flag to control the visibility and transition of the card.

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the `ExecBoardCards` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ExecBoardCards from "./ExecBoardCards";

function App() {
    return (
        <ExecBoardCards
            role="President"
            name="John Doe"
            pronouns="He/Him"
            major="Computer Science"
            classStanding="Senior"
            linkedin="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
            img="https://example.com/image.jpg"
            email="john.doe@example.com"
            isVisible={true}
        />
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Rendered UI

The `ExecBoardCards` component renders a card with the following UI elements:

- An image of the board member.
- The name of the board member, which links to their personal website or LinkedIn profile.
- The major, role, class standing, and pronouns of the board member displayed as text.
- Icons linking to the board member's LinkedIn profile and email.

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Tailwind CSS classes are used for controlling text styles, colors, and the overall layout. 

## Transitions

The component has a transition effect which is controlled by the `isVisible` prop. When `isVisible` is `true`, the card appears with full opacity and no vertical translation. When `isVisible` is `false`, the card has zero opacity and is translated vertically down by a small amount, creating a fade-out and slide-down effect on hiding.

## Accessibility

The image includes an `alt` attribute to provide a text alternative for screen readers, improving the accessibility of the component.

- React
- Next.UI
