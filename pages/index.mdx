# Introduction
 
Welcome to the Emerging Coders Website Documentation!
The purpose of this website is to provided a detailed 
description of how the website was built, the different 
components/libraries used, and the overall structure 
and process that was used to build the website

## What is Emerging Coders?

Emerging Coders is a student organization at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). 
Emerging Coders is a community for FGLI (First-generation, Low-income) students 
who are interested in Tech.â€¯Our purpose is to enable students in the 
club improve their skills (e.g., coding projects, networking etc.), 
provide mentorship and resources throughout your college experience, 
and to create meaningful projects.

Since we've started out as an organization in Fall Quarter 2022, 
we've grown to over 250 followers on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nu.emergingcoders/) and [GroupMe](https://web.groupme.com/join_group/89417887/c1x6DI3U).
We've also been able to partner with companies such as [Adobe](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyB4NALu4qP/)
and [Google](https://www.instagram.com/p/CymMANqOlED/)


Because we have grown quickly as a student organization, we wanted to build a website that would enable us to reach more Northwestern students and provide them with information about our organization and provide them with resources that would help them in their career. Likewise, we wanted to establish a more formal online presence that would allow us to partner with more companies and organizations.
