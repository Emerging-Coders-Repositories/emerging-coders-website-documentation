## Setting Up the Codebase

To get started with the development, you'll need to fork and clone the repository to your local machine. Below are the steps to guide you through this process:

Before doing this, make sure you have [Node.js](/setup/node) and [Github Command Line Tools](/setup/node) installed on your machine.

### Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Emerging Coders Website repository](https://github.com/ethanpaneraa/Emerging-Coders-Website) on GitHub.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Now, go to your fork of the Emerging Coders Website repository in your GitHub account.
2. Click the **Code** button (it's green) found at the top-right part of the repository.
3. Copy the URL provided in the HTTPS tab.
4. Open a terminal on your machine.
5. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
6. Run the following command, replacing `your-username` with your GitHub username:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emerging-Coders-Website.git
   ```

### Loading the Codebase

1. Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Emerging-Coders-Website
   ```
2. Now, install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you prefer using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

Now, the project should be running locally on your machine. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website. As you make changes to the code, the website will automatically update to reflect those changes, thanks to the hot-reloading feature provided by Next.js.
